# City Crime Livability Analyzer

This program was made as a school project, to return the ideal part of a given city for the user to live in, given user preferences. The program would be given a sorted csv of crimes in a city, and dynamic user-inputted crime severity ratings, whether the user rates all crimes or chooses a pre-set crime rating profile (ie student, family, etc). In return, the program would calculate which districts of the city are the best based on the crime severity occurring in that district, scored by the user's crime ratings.

The resulting district is given in terms of that district's score, as well as the score of districts around it. This makes sure that the user will have the most confortable living environment, based on their specific wants.

This project was made possible through Lucas Zacharewicz, Mohammad Hussain, Giacomo Loparco, and Jacob Gordon
